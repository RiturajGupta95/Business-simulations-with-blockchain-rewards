# Business Simulations with Blockchain Rewards

## Project Description

**Business Simulations with Blockchain Rewards** is a decentralized platform that allows users to participate in business simulations and earn blockchain-based rewards. The platform uses Ethereum smart contracts to automate the process of tracking user scores and distributing rewards in the form of ERC20 tokens. This ensures transparency, fairness, and security for both the users and the platform administrators. Participants earn rewards based on their performance in the simulation, fostering engagement and providing real-world incentives for learning and improvement.

## Contract Address

This smart contract is deployed EDU Chain the Ethereum network. The contract address for the **Business Simulations with Blockchain Rewards** project is:

## Project Vision

The vision of this project is to create a decentralized and gamified learning platform that incentivizes business education and decision-making through blockchain technology. The goal is to reward users for their participation and achievements in business simulations, providing verifiable rewards that have real-world value. By leveraging blockchain, we aim to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in the reward distribution process, while allowing participants to showcase their progress in a secure and immutable way.

### Key Objectives:
- **Engage users in simulations** that teach business skills.
- **Reward participation** through blockchain-based token rewards.
- **Provide transparency** in reward distribution through the use of smart contracts.
- **Ensure fairness** by automating score tracking and reward allocation.

## Key Features

### 1. **Decentralized Reward System**
   - Users earn **ERC20 tokens** as rewards based on their performance in the business simulations. The reward distribution is managed directly by the smart contract, ensuring that the process is transparent and automatic.

### 2. **Automated Score Tracking**
   - The platform's **admin (owner)** updates the scores of users based on their performance. These scores determine the amount of tokens that users will receive as rewards.

### 3. **Reward Calculation**
   - Users earn **1 token for every 100 points** they score in the simulation. The reward system is simple but could be extended to include more complex reward structures.

### 4. **Transparency and Security**
   - All transactions are securely recorded on the **Ethereum blockchain**. This ensures that the process of updating scores and distributing rewards is tamper-proof and verifiable.

### 5. **Owner-Controlled Score Updates**
   - Only the **contract owner** (platform administrator) can update scores, ensuring that the process is managed by a trusted authority. However, this also means that users cannot alter their scores independently.

### 6. **Token Withdrawals by Owner**
   - The contract owner has the ability to withdraw tokens from the contract, which provides flexibility for managing the token pool used for rewards. This feature ensures that the reward pool can be topped up when necessary.

### 7. **Event Logging**
   - The contract emits **events** such as `ScoreUpdated` and `RewardDistributed` to log actions performed by the contract, allowing participants and admins to track changes on the blockchain.

## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Metamask** or any Web3-compatible wallet.
- An **Ethereum testnet** (e.g., Rinkeby or Goerli) to deploy and interact with the contract.
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) for any additional setup if working with a front-end integration.

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   - Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby) or mainnet using **Remix IDE**, **Truffle**, or **Hardhat**.
   - Ensure that you have the address of an ERC20 token that will be used for rewarding participants.

2. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - After deploying the contract, interact with it using **Metamask** to update scores, distribute rewards, and check user balances.
   - You can create a front-end application (using **React**, **Web3.js**, or **Ethers.js**) to allow users to submit their scores and view their rewards.

3. **Monitoring the Contract**:
   - All actions such as score updates and reward distributions are logged on-chain. Use **Etherscan** or a similar blockchain explorer to view transaction details.

### Example Interactions:
- **Updating Scores**: The contract owner can update user scores by calling the `updateScore` function, passing in the user's address and score.
- **Distributing Rewards**: After the score update, the contract automatically calculates the reward based on the score and transfers tokens to the userâ€™s address.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Reward Mechanism**: Adding bonuses or multipliers for exceptional performance in simulations.
- **User-Driven Score Submissions**: Allowing users to submit their own scores with validation from the platform owner.
- **Leaderboard**: Implementing a leaderboard where the top performers are highlighted and receive additional rewards.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Enabling integration with other educational or gaming platforms to expand the reach of the project.
